# Flammable-gas-detection-systemsystem
An Arduino-based IoT project utilizing the MQ2 gas detection sensor to monitor and alert gas levels in real-time. The project integrates with the Blynk IoT platform to display sensor data, send notifications, and enable remote control via a mobile app. Ideal for detecting combustible gases such as LPG, methane, and smoke.
