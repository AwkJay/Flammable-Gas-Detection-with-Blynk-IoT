_An Arduino-based IoT project utilizing the MQ2 gas detection sensor to monitor and alert gas levels in real-time. The project integrates with the Blynk IoT platform to display sensor data, send notifications, and enable remote control via a mobile app. Ideal for detecting combustible gases such as LPG, methane, and smoke, this project enhances safety and convenience through IoT automation._

**Features:**

1)Real-time gas level monitoring using the MQ2 sensor.

Blynk IoT integration for remote visualization and control.

3)Configurable alerts for gas concentration thresholds.

4)Easy-to-build and beginner-friendly Arduino implementation.



**Hardware Requirements:**
1)Arduino board (e.g., UNO, Nano, etc.)

2)MQ2 gas sensor module

3)Blynk IoT mobile app

4)Jumper wires and breadboard



**Software Requirements:**

1)Arduino IDE with required libraries (Blynk library, MQ2 sensor library, etc.)

2)Blynk IoT account for app setup
